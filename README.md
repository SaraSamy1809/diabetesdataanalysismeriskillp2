Diabetes Analysis

**Report**

1-The objective of the data is to predict whether a person has diabetes or not, according to various given measurements.

2-**Processing:**
The data given contains lots of Nulls, duplicates, and missing data. Also, there are zeros in medical fields like blood pressure, glucose, insulin, Diabetes pedigree function, BMI, and skin thickness. Also, I checked that the constraints given regarding age are applied as well.

3-**Analyze:**

From calculating the mean of all fields, maximum, and minimum as well, It was noticed that most values are higher for those with diabetes than those for non-diabetes. Mostly high in the glucose, insulin, and BMI fields.

When checking the correlation of all fields, Glucose scored a strong relationship with the outcome, as well as pregnancies and Age, skin thickness and BMI, and glucose and insulin stated a very strong correlation.

As for the rest of the relations between fields, they provided a moderate to weak correlation but all were above zero.

As for the diabetes data, We have a high count of patients of age between 21 and 30, where the majority has a BMI is on average of 30, pregnancies number is less than 5, blood pressure between 69 to 77, diabetes pedigree function 0.19, glucose varies between 125 and 166 but the insulin is 124, and skin thickness is 32 and 23.

As for the same age group for non-diabetes, the majority of values fall under the following, almost the same, but at lower levels for glucose, insulin, and pregnancy numbers as well.

As for the level of glucose, for diabetes, the average blood pressure increases above the average as well, along with insulin. the same thing goes with insulin as well. 

Other factors are either the same or have a slight decrease.

4-**Conclusion:**
  Diabetes people have a high level of glucose along with insulin as well, age and blood pressure might as well be an indicator especially if blood pressure is above 70.
